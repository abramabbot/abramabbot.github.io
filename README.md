## Hi, I'm Abe

- I'm an antiquated-technology enthusiast with "nigh infinite patience for researching weird systems"
- Right now, I'm working on formalizing my knowledge of CRM/ERP systems like Salesforce
- In the future, I'm looking to shift my career towards knowledge management of legacy systems
